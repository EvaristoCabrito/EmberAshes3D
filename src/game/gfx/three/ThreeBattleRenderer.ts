/** MILESTONE 1 (done) — terrain, ground/behind-layer decorations, and animated unit sprites all
 * render through a real Three.js scene instead of the Canvas2D-shim WebGL renderer, as the first
 * slice of migrating the battlefield to a genuine spatial rendering environment (see the
 * architecture note below). "Front"-layer/foreground props still render through the existing
 * Canvas2D-shim units canvas, unchanged, stacked on top — this renderer replaces the
 * ground/terrain canvas and everything meant to draw under a unit, never anything meant to draw
 * in front of one (see BattleCanvas.tsx).
 *
 * MILESTONE 2 (done) — real DirectionalLight + AmbientLight-ish HemisphereLight, and real cast
 * shadows from invisible per-unit/per-decoration boxes with a synthetic elevation (see
 * shadowCasterMaterial/updateSun and THREEJS_MILESTONE2_HANDOFF.md).
 *
 * MILESTONE 3 (in progress) — real world-space ground mist + GPU-instanced drift particles (see
 * ThreeAtmosphere.ts, which owns this entirely — this file only constructs it, syncs it once per
 * frame, and disposes it). No bloom/post-processing yet, that's Milestone 4.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: every tile mesh is built ONCE at its fixed WORLD position (the same formula
 * BattleEngine.effectAnchor already uses for worldX/worldY) and never moves again. Camera
 * panning moves the CAMERA, not the tiles — a real spatial scene, not screen-space coordinates
 * recomputed every frame. This is what makes later milestones (real DirectionalLight/shadows,
 * world-space fog, depth-sorted particles) possible without another rewrite: every tile has an
 * actual, stable position in a 3D world a light or a fog volume can reason about.
 *
 * COORDINATE CONVENTION: the orthographic camera's frustum is a STANDARD (left=0, right=cssW,
 * top=cssH, bottom=0) one — top > bottom, the normal orientation. An orthographic camera with
 * an inverted frustum (top < bottom), which is what a naive "world Y increases down the screen"
 * port of BattleEngine's cx/cy convention would want, renders nothing at all in this Three.js
 * version (confirmed empirically: identical scene/camera/mesh renders correctly with a standard
 * frustum and renders nothing with an inverted one, regardless of camera or mesh position —
 * some part of the projection/clipping pipeline silently assumes top > bottom). So the Y-flip
 * BattleEngine's convention needs happens elsewhere instead: every mesh is placed at Y = -wy
 * (see hexWorld) rather than +wy, and the camera's own Y position is offset by -camY - cssH to
 * match. Both are derived once, together, in render()/ensureBuilt() — verified numerically
 * against BattleEngine's own cx/cy formula, not just visually. This still lets every other
 * system (mouse picking via BattleEngine.cellAt, hover/selection highlighting, unit sprites on
 * the Canvas2D-shim units canvas, panBy/zoom) keep working completely unchanged: they all
 * operate in CSS-pixel space, which this renderer's on-screen RESULT still matches exactly —
 * only the intermediate Three.js coordinates carry the flip, nothing outside this file does. */
